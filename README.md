#### It's my game engine. Again.


## Getting started
In the project folder, you will find the showcase project scripts. They are commented out so you can see how to do most things. Also, make sure to use intellisence as it will allow you to easily see the documentation for various functions and variables.

This is a work in progress and to be honest there aint that many comments nor are there more than one project script. Hopefully about to change that.
